    "htmlwidgets": "A framework for creating HTML widgets that render in various\n    contexts including the R console, 'R Markdown' documents, and 'Shiny'\n    web applications.",
    "forcats": "Helpers for reordering factor levels (including moving\n    specified levels to front, ordering by first appearance, reversing,\n    and randomly shuffling), and tools for modifying factor levels\n    (including collapsing rare levels into other, 'anonymising', and\n    manually 'recoding').",
    "askpass": "Cross-platform utilities for prompting the user for credentials or a \n    passphrase, for example to authenticate with a server or read a protected key.\n    Includes native programs for MacOS and Windows, hence no 'tcltk' is required. \n    Password entry can be invoked in two different ways: directly from R via the \n    askpass() function, or indirectly as password-entry back-end for 'ssh-agent' \n    or 'git-credential' via the SSH_ASKPASS and GIT_ASKPASS environment variables.\n    Thereby the user can be prompted for credentials or a passphrase if needed \n    when R calls out to git or ssh.",

    "bslib": "Simplifies custom 'CSS' styling of both 'shiny' and\n    'rmarkdown' via 'Bootstrap' 'Sass'. Supports 'Bootstrap' 3, 4 and 5 as\n    well as their various 'Bootswatch' themes. An interactive widget is\n    also provided for previewing themes in real time."
